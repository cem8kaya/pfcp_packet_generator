## Description

The PFCP Packet Generator is a tool designed to simulate realistic PFCP (Packet Forwarding Control Protocol) traffic in a 5G core network environment. It generates PFCP messages according to 3GPP specifications(3GPP TS 29.244), creating both request and response messages for various PFCP procedures.

Key Components:

1. **Configuration Manager**: Loads user-defined settings for the simulation.

2. **Session Manager**: Simulates PFCP session lifecycles, managing session states and transitions.

3. **Message Generator**: Creates PFCP messages with appropriate Information Elements (IEs) for different message types.

4. **Packet Creator**: Assembles complete network packets, including IP and UDP headers.

5. **PCAP Writer**: Writes generated packets to a PCAP file for analysis.

6. **Statistics Collector**: Gathers and reports statistics on generated traffic.

The generator supports various PFCP message types, including Association Setup, Session Establishment, Modification, and Deletion. It implements realistic IEs such as PDRs, FARs, QERs, and URRs, and simulates 5G-specific elements like QFI.

1. Node ID (8.2.38)
2. F-SEID (8.2.39)
3. Recovery Time Stamp (8.2.41)
4. Cause (8.2.1)

## Simulated Procedures

1. PFCP Association Setup (TS 29.244 Section 6.2.1)
   - Establishment of PFCP Association between CP and UP functions

2. PFCP Session Establishment (TS 29.244 Section 6.3.1)
   - Creation of an PFCP session

3. PFCP Session Modification (TS 29.244 Section 6.3.2)
   - Modification of an existing PFCP session

4. PFCP Session Deletion (TS 29.244 Section 6.3.3)
   - Removal of an existing PFCP session

5. PFCP Heartbeat Procedure (TS 29.244 Section 6.5.1)
   - Keep-alive mechanism between CP and UP functions

## Supported Features

1. Basic N4 Interface Simulation
   - Communication between SMF (CP function) and UPF (UP function)

2. Session Context Handling
   - Generation of CP F-SEID and UP F-SEID for session management

3. Cause Handling
   - Inclusion of Cause IE in response messages (e.g., Request accepted)

4. Sequence Number Management
   - Proper sequence number handling in request-response pairs

5. PFCP Header Formatting (TS 29.244 Section 6.1)
   - Correct formatting of PFCP message headers

6. PFCP Node ID Handling

## Limitations and Simplifications

1. Limited IE Set
   - Only basic IEs are implemented; complex IEs (e.g., PDR, FAR, QER, URR) are not yet supported

2. Simplified Session Management
   - Basic session lifecycle without detailed state management

3. No QoS Handling
   - QoS-related IEs and procedures are not implemented

4. Limited 5G Support
   - 5G-specific elements (e.g., QFI) are not yet implemented

5. No Error Handling
   - All requests are assumed to be successful; no error scenarios are simulated

6. No Usage Reporting
   - Usage reporting mechanisms are not implemented

7. Simplified Packet Forwarding
   - Complex forwarding scenarios are not simulated

8. No Network Slicing Support
   - NSSAI and network slicing features are not implemented

This implementation provides a basic framework for PFCP message exchange simulation, focusing on the fundamental message types and procedures. It serves as a starting point for more complex PFCP traffic generation, with room for expansion to include more detailed IE structures, 5G-specific features, and advanced PFCP procedures as defined in 3GPP TS 29.244.



## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Scapy library


## Usage

1. Configure the simulation parameters in `config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   source_ip: "192.0.2.1"
   destination_ip: "192.0.2.2"
   num_sessions: 10
   simulation_duration: 300  # seconds
   ```

2. Run the generator:
   ```
   python pfcp_generator.py
   ```

3. Find the generated PCAP file in the `output` directory.

## Customization

- Modify `message_templates.py` to adjust PFCP message structures.
- Edit `ie_templates.py` to customize Information Elements.

## Analysis

Use Wireshark or other packet analysis tools to examine the generated PCAP files.
