## Description

The PFCP Packet Generator is a tool designed to simulate realistic PFCP (Packet Forwarding Control Protocol) traffic in a 5G core network environment. It generates PFCP messages according to 3GPP specifications(3GPP TS 29.244), creating both request and response messages for various PFCP procedures.

Key Components:

1. **Configuration Manager**: Loads user-defined settings for the simulation.

2. **Session Manager**: Simulates PFCP session lifecycles, managing session states and transitions.

3. **Message Generator**: Creates PFCP messages with appropriate Information Elements (IEs) for different message types.

4. **Packet Creator**: Assembles complete network packets, including IP and UDP headers.

5. **PCAP Writer**: Writes generated packets to a PCAP file for analysis.

6. **Statistics Collector**: Gathers and reports statistics on generated traffic.

The generator supports various PFCP message types, including Association Setup, Session Establishment, Modification, and Deletion. It implements realistic IEs such as PDRs, FARs, QERs, and URRs, and simulates 5G-specific elements like QFI.
